# Welcome to Project Laura

This project is a Python-based project that requires a virtual environment to run. Below are the guidelines to set up the project.

## Setting up the Virtual Environment

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `laura-env`:

```bash
python -m venv laura-env
```

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
source laura-env/bin/activate
```

On Windows, use the following command instead:

```bash
laura-env\Scripts\activate
```

You should now see the name of the virtual environment printed on your terminal or command prompt, indicating that it has been activated.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following Python files:

- `main.py`
- `laura_module.py`
- `utils.py`

### main.py
This is the entry point of the project. It imports and runs the `laura` function from `laura_module.py`.

```python
import laura_module

if __name__ == "__main__":
    laura_module.laura()
```

### laura_module.py
This file contains the `laura` function, which is the core logic of the project.

```python
def laura():
    print("Hello, Laura!")
```

### utils.py
This file contains utility functions that can be used throughout the project.

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This should print "Hello, Laura!" to the console.

That's it! You should now have a fully functional Project Laura setup with a virtual environment and three Python files.
